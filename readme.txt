I have created a MVC pattern using php to develop Aweber API.
I used this pattern because I want this project to be scalable and you can add more featerurs to this by adding controllers and using MYSQL Database in future.

I am trying to follow the Laravel structure on this project.

All configuration must be place in the config.php file and on the index.php defines the routes avaible and controller. It also have a 404 and action not found handlers as of now and 
I am trying to improve this structure and use it on my small projects.
